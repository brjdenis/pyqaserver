Image review
=============
This is a complementary module that can be used to extract image pixel data.  It is not part of Pylinac.

Chose the image you wish to inspect and click Display. In the resulting diagram you can:

* use the crosshair to observe profiles,
* draw a rectangle with the select box to get pixel info,
* change the gray-scale display by moving slider level.

If needed, you can invert the image or convert HU back to pixel data.
