Doing tests on Elekta linacs with QAserver
=======================================================

Hi there! This page contains some notes about doing interesting tests on Elekta linacs with QAserver. 

This is the main page:

`QAserver <https://github.com/brjdenis/qaserver>`_


The notes are part of QAserver's documentation, so go read the rest too: `documentation <https://brjdenis.github.io/qaserver/docs/version1.0/html/>`_. It's not a lot, but then it's the little things in life that are of value, large things just cast a big dark shadow on everything and give you an even bigger headache.
