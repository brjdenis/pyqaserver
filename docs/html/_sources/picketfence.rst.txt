Picket fence
==============================================

Neither Pylinac nor QAserver are compatible with Elekta's VMAT CAT picket fence pattern. But you can create a picket fence beam for Agility with iCOM CAT. Here is an example file:

`Example picket fence <https://github.com/brjdenis/qaserver/blob/master/files/icomcat.zip>`_

It think there should be more control points in this beam, but I didn't have the time to figure it out. Maybe you can. The results of the test should be excellent for Agility collimator.
